#NeuralFlex prosthetic finger 
Welcome to the open-source project for the development of a prosthetic finger with neural interface capabilities. 

#overview 
This project aims to create a bionic prosthetic finger that leverages neural signals for natural movement. By interfacing with the muscles in the remaining part of the finger, we can capture electromyographic (EMG) signals to control the bionic finger's movements. 

#features 
Neural interface:
Capture muscle signals to control the prosthetic finger. 
Bionic movement: mimics natural finger movements for enhanced fonctionality. 
Open Source:
Collaborative development with the community. 

Components
Muscle electrode:
Captures EMG signals for movement detection. 
Circuit board: processes signals and controls bionic finger movements. 
Bionic finger: mechanism for natural finger movement.
